===============
Release History
===============

0.7.0
-----
* Refactored errors handling code:
  It now is much easier and more flexible for mixing in other form based classes.
* Added a date validator using an AngularJS directive. 
* Added another view, which can be used for NgModelMixin without NgValidationMixin.
* Added new directory to handle client code. Grunt now builds, verifies and concatenates that code.
* A minified version is available as ``django-angular.min.js``

0.6.3
-----
* **ADOPT YOUR SOURCES**:
  The Javascript file ``/static/js/djng-websocket.js`` has been moved and renamed to
  ``/static/djangular/js/django-angular.js``
* Internal error messages generated by server side validation, now are mixed with AngularJS's
  validation errors.
* A special list-item is added to the list of errors. It is shown if the input field contains valid
  data.
* Input fields of bound forms, now display the content of the field, as expected. This requires the
  Angular module ``ng.django.forms``.

0.6.2
-----
* Refactored ``NgFormValidationMixin``, so that potential AngularJS errors do not interfere with
  Django's internal error list. This now allows to use the same form definition for bound and
  unbound forms.
