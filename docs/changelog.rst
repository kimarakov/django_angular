Release History
===============

0.6.3
-----
* Renamed Javascript file ``djangular/static/js/djng-websocket.js`` -> ``djangular/static/js/django-angular.js``
* Internal error messages generated by server side validation, now are mixed with AngularJS's
  validation errors.
* Input fields of bound forms, now display the content of the field, as expected. This requires the
  Angular module ``ng.django.forms``.

  Django's internal error list. This now allows to use the same form definition for bound and
  unbound forms.
